# Pipeline-Network-Design
Design a natural gas pipeline network for residential areas.

The network in Figures/Figure 1 covers the natural gas needs of houses connected to residential areas' network nodes. Gas enters the network at node 1 and the total pressure of the network at node 1 is 30 mbar. The total volume flow rate of the network is 1000 m^3/h. The demand for the design volume flow rate by consumers (m3/h) is given in the Figure 1.

The task is to select suitable diameters for the pipes of the network. Standard diameters for polyethylene pipes SDR 11 from Figures/Table 1.

1) Network design requirements:
(a) The pressure should not drop below 25.5 mbar at any point in the network.
(b) The flow velocity should not exceed 8 m/s in any pipeline of the network for the avoidance of whistling.

2) Calculate the variation in operating pressure at the network nodes during the day. Values of daily flow variation are provided in Figures/Table 2.

The attributes of the pipelines are specified in the params.json .
